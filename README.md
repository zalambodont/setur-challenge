# Setur Challenge

This is my take on current setur.com.tr website.
The project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). 

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install` or `yarn install`

Creates node_modules directory and downloads required dependencies

### `npm start` or `yarn start`

This will run the project so you can see the outcome locally.
